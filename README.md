# golang-mid
Midterm project using Golang

I have a struct of Post

Functions is getallposts{/posts}, getsinglepost{/posts/{id}}, updatepost{/posts/{id}}

I haven't use sync.Mutex for this project, but in Postman it works great. Also I didn't add database, I just created array where I have items, to check that all functions works, but when you update something and restart a project I starts from what I entered to an array.
